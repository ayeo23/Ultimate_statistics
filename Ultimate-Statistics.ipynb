    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "All conclusions were reached by running simulations with one million throws. Teams were always composed of three handlers and four cutters, with **two male handlers and one female handler**, and the other four players (two female and two male) are cutters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment1: \n",
    "* If throws were purely random and positions were meaningless, female receivers (or, really, the gender with 3 players) would receive 43% of passes, while male receivers (or the gender with 4 players) would receive 57% of passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A assuming two player positions (cutters and handlers) and cutters always threw to handlers and vice versa, females are expected to receive ~42% of passes to ~58% for males. This is a **negligable change from Experiment 1, or a purely random team**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assumming that handlers always received 2/3 of passes, regardless of who the thrower was, females are expected to receive ~39% of passes and males ~61% of passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming an **extreme scenario where handlers always received 90% of passes**, regardless of who the thrower was, females are expected to receive ~35% of passes and males ~65%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, assuming that the majority of teams play 3:4 female-male with two male and one female handlers, it is likely that the results observed in the ultiworld article are a measurement of a throwing bias. That is, in the context of the four experiments shown here, the article likely did observe a trend where players tended to not throw to female players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative explainations that would involve no throwing bias might include:\n",
    "* Teams ran lots of all male handler lines, possibly suggesting intrinsic, tactical reasons to play males at handler positions in mixed games (possible, but unlikely).\n",
    "* The players observed in the article have vast skill differences between genders (again, possible, but unlikely given that this is nationals).\n",
    "* The plays or strategies that teams ran under(over) utilized the female(male) players, meaning there is a 'strategic bias' rather than a throwing bias."
