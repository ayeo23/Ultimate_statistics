And, similar to both sports, players tend to have skewed statistics on their usage percentage -- some players are high volume and others low.\n",

Alternatively, if all positions were equivalent then one would expect the usage percent to be split according to a 4:3 ratio. Factoring in asymmetric positions, we turn to numerical simulations to find the expected usage ratios."
